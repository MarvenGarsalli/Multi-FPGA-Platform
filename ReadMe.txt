Because of the insufficiency of the hardware resources of one FPGA to support advanced huge projects, several company like Xilinx resort to produce multi-FPGA boards that support many FPGAs.
This project in the context of Design and Development Project withing Mentor Graphics allow users to customize their mother boards (multi-FPGA boards).
